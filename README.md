# slickgrid

Find documentation and examples in [the wiki](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki).


**UPDATE:  March 5th, 2014 - I have too many things going on in my life right now to really give SlickGrid support and development the time and attention it deserves.  I am not stopping it, but I will most likely be unresponsive for some time.  Sorry.**

## require notes

Unlike typical modules you cannot ```require('slickgrid')``` directly. You should require the specific submodules you need.

```js
var SlickGrid = require('slickgrid/grid');
var SlickData = require('slickgrid/dataview');
```

## install

```
npm install slickgrid
```

Use with [browserify](http://browserify.org)
